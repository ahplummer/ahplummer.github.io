Below are some random things I‚Äôve learned from very specific failures in my career:

(In no particular order):

* Don‚Äôt assume everyone understands me.  
* When in doubt, keep my mouth shut.  
* When creating meetings, I need to have the right place, time, agenda, and people.
* It seems like more work up front, but I should design solutions with testing in mind (can be called TDD).
* Always strive for efficiency - even if it means changing team ceremonies up, or changing roles around.
* Treat infrastructure like cattle, not pets.
* Treat people like people.
* Think scale now - even on a very trivial application.
* My teammates want to know they are contributing to the company‚Äôs bottom line.
* The people that work for me are my teammates.
* Keep priorities straight - there‚Äôs a pink slip somewhere with my name on it.
* Either keep immaculate records, or keep none.
* Much time is wasted with ‚Äúlife hacks‚Äù and organizational tips.
* Work-life balance is an esoteric term and hard to quantify; I‚Äôll know it when I see it.
* Brevity over verbosity.
* Emoticons/emojis can help soften what is considered terseness. üôÇ
* Don‚Äôt overuse emoticons/emojis.
* Continue hacking and slinging code - it is cathartic and keeps the blade sharpened.
