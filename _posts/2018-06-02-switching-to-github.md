I've moved to Github (using Jekyll) finally.  I was running a Hugo site on my VPS, but decided that I'd simplify with just using Github. "Static Content" sites have become the rage these days, in response to the bloatware that open-source CMS systems have become.  It's indeed interesting how new things are sort of recycled from older ideas.  

Sometimes, minimalism is best, even with technology.
